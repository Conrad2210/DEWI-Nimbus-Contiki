This demonstrator version contains some messages and methods to build a dummy
topology by one node advertising itself as master and the others joining as
child nodes. These bits should be removed later when the topology will result
from CIDER instead. This applies in particular to the creation, reception and
handling of APP_PACKETS of subtype MASTERMSG and CHILDMSG.
